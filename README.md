Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.
These dotfiles are the bare minimum to provide an environment which I'm comfortable working with.
It should work on macOS and Linux based systems.

If you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are
awesome, you might want to [read holman's post on the subject](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

# Installation
**Disclaimer:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. *Use at your own risk!*

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bastilimbach/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && source script/bootstrap
```

You should really consider checking out the original [holman dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). He explained the installation process in detail.

# Contribution
I really appreciate every contribution, but these are my personal dotfiles which I use on every machine I own. So there is a good chance, that I might not merge your PR because I don't need that `feature/fix/improvement`.
If you find a serious issue, you should create a PR over at [holman dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). I try to continually keep this fork up to date with the upstream.
